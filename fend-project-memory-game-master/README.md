## About

This project was based off the Udacity Front End Network Developer project - Memory Game. Starting with the Udacity HTML and JS, functionality was added to turn the memory game from a static idea to a dynamic game!

## Instructions

Open the Memory HTML file in your browser to play!
Click the tiles one at a time. Find the matching pairs in as few moves as possible to earn all your stars.
Then hit refresh to play again!
